# task-management

## introduction
The objective of this assignment is to build a simplified Task Management Application. This application serves as a basic platform where
users can create, view, update, and delete tasks.
Each task includes a title, a detailed description, and a status (e.g.,
"Pending" or "Completed").

This is a common application type that allows us to evaluate your approach to developing both backend and frontend
solutions, as well as your ability to manage data consistency, handle user interactions, and write maintainable code.

## Part 1: Backend (Golang)
### Objective:
Build a simple REST API for managing a list of tasks, where each task has a title, description, status, and creation timestamp.

### Requirements:
1. Create a new task
2. Read the details of an existing task by ID
3. Update a task's title, description, or status
4. Delete a task

### Technical Expectations:
Language: Golang
Database: Use any lightweight, in-memory database (e.g., SQLite or in-memory structs) to keep it simple
API Design: Follow RESTful conventions
Testing: Write unit tests for each endpoint
Documentation: Include a README file with setup instructions and describe your design choices
Evaluation Criteria:
Clear and logical API design
Code quality and organization
Comprehensive unit tests
Documentation quality
